## Product Overview
The Personal CRM App is designed to help users manage their contacts, tasks, and interactions efficiently. The app will provide a user-friendly interface, allowing users to track their relationships and stay organized. The application will be developed in four phases: an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), a refined version, a final product, and a production-ready version. The app will feature a soothing design with modern aesthetics, playful elements, sleek animations, and a professional flow throughout, making it look as if it were developed by a professional app development company. The design will draw inspiration from the UI of brands like OnePlus and Apple, utilizing elegant fonts and layouts.
